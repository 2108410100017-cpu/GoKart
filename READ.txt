# 🚀 Smart Lemonade Stand – End-to-End MLOps Pipeline

**FastAPI · Airflow · MLflow · Scikit-Learn · WSL**

> An industry-style MLOps project that demonstrates a complete ML feedback loop — from online inference to automated retraining and model promotion — orchestrated using Apache Airflow.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world MLOps lifecycle where:

* A model serves live predictions
* Requests are logged
* Ground truth arrives later
* New datasets are created
* Models are retrained and evaluated
* Only better models are promoted
* Everything is automated via Airflow

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Predict whether a customer will buy lemonade based on:

* 🌡️ Temperature
* 🕒 Time of day

Focus: maintaining model performance over time, not one-off training.

## 🏗️ Architecture (High Level)

Client → FastAPI → Logs → Ground Truth → Dataset → Retrain → MLflow → Airflow

## ▶️ Running Locally

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

```bash
airflow standalone
```

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

* Demonstrates production ML thinking
* Shows real MLOps lifecycle
* No notebooks, fully operational
